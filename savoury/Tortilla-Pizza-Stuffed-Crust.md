# Tortilla Pizza — Stuffed Crust (Triangle)


## Ingredients

### Base
- 1 large flour tortilla (burrito size)

### Stuffed crust
- 3 thin sausages (chipolata size)
- 3 chunks of mozerella/cheddar/

### Sauce & cheese
- 2 tbsp red pesto or pizza sauce
- 50–70g grated mozzarella

### Toppings
- 2–3 tbsp finely diced red pepper
- Optional: chilli flakes, dried oregano

### Extras
- 3 cocktail sticks (optional, to secure seams)
- Oil for brushing (optional)

## Method

1. **Preheat & prepare:**
   - Heat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan). Line a baking tray with baking paper.

1. **Cook the sausages for the Crust**
    - Add 3 sausages per pizza to a pan over low heat
    - Cook until cooked through and turning Gold

2. **Form the sausage triangle (stuffed crust):**
   - Lay the tortilla flat. Place the 3 sausages in a triangle about 2–3 cm from the edge.
   - Fold one side of the tortilla up and over the first sausage, rolling tightly so the sausage is enclosed.
   - Repeat for the remaining two sides so the folds meet and form a raised triangular border.
   - Tuck and press the seams together; secure with cocktail sticks if needed.

3. **Fill the centre:**
   - Spread the red pesto inside the central triangle, keeping the crust clear.
   - Add the grated mozzarella and scatter diced red pepper. Season lightly.
   - Avoid overfilling — leave space for the cheese to melt.

4. **Bake:**
   - Place on the lined tray and bake for 12–15 minutes until the tortilla edges are golden and the cheese is bubbling.
   - Optional: grill for 1–2 minutes for extra browning.

5. **Rest & serve:**
   - Remove cocktail sticks, let rest 2–3 minutes, slice through the centre and serve.

## Tips

- Use pre-cooked sausages (or pre-cook raw ones) so they heat through without overcooking the tortilla.
- Thin sausages (chipolata) are easiest to fold—thicker sausages can create bulky seams.
- Brush the folded edges with a little oil for extra crispness.
- Vegetarian variation: swap sausages for halloumi strips or plant-based sausages.
