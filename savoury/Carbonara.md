## Pasta Carbonara

Ingredients:
• 200 grams whole wheat spaghetti (or any whole grain pasta)
• 2 large eggs
• 50 grams grated Parmesan cheese
• 120 grams single cream
• 75 grams peas (optional, for added vegetables)
• 1/2 small onion, diced small
• 50 grams bacon/lardons, diced
• 2 cloves garlic, minced
• 15 ml olive oil (1 tablespoon)
• Salt and black pepper to taste
• Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
Instructions: 1. Cook the Pasta:
○ Cook the whole wheat spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 240 milliliters (1 cup) of pasta cooking water before draining. 2. Prepare the Sauce:
○ In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, Greek yogurt, and grated Parmesan cheese until smooth. Set aside. 3. Cook the bacon:
○ In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced turkey bacon or prosciutto and cook until crispy. Remove from the skillet and set aside. 4. Sauté Vegetables:
○ In the same skillet, add minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Add peas (if using) and onion, cooking until the onion is browned and peas are tender. 5. Combine Everything:
○ Reduce the heat to low. Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the vegetables and turkey bacon. Mix well.
○ Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly to coat the pasta without scrambling the eggs. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time until you achieve a creamy consistency. 6. Season and Serve:
Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Serve immediately, garnished with fresh parsley and a bit more grated Parmesan if desired.
