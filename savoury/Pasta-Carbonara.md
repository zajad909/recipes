# Pasta Carbonara

## Ingredients

### Pasta

- 200g spaghetti (or any pasta you prefer)

### Eggs & Cheese

- 2 large eggs
- 50g grated Parmesan cheese
- 120ml single cream

### Vegetables & Meat

- 1 sweet pointed red peppers (bell peppers also work
- 1-2 shallots OR 1/2 small onion, diced small
- 50g diced pancetta (bacon or lardons also work but pancetta tastes the best)
- 75g peas (optional, for added vegetables)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)

### Extras

- 15ml olive oil (1 tablespoon)
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Method

1. **Cook the Pasta:**
   - Cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente.
   - Reserve 240ml (1 cup) of pasta cooking water before draining.

2. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, single cream, and grated Parmesan cheese until smooth.
   - Set aside.

3. **Cook the Bacon:**
   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
   - Add the diced pancetta/bacon/lardons and cook until crispy.
   - Remove from the skillet and set aside.

4. **Sauté Vegetables:**
   - In the same skillet, add minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.
   - Add peas (if using) and onion, cooking until the onion is browned and peas are tender.

5. **Combine Everything:**
   - Reduce the heat to low.
   - Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the vegetables and bacon.
   - Mix well.
   - Pour the egg mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly to coat the pasta without scrambling the eggs.
   - Add reserved pasta water a little at a time until you achieve a creamy consistency.

6. **Season and Serve:**
   - Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
   - Serve immediately, garnished with fresh parsley and a bit more grated Parmesan if desired.

## Tips

- Be careful not to scramble the eggs when combining with the pasta - keep the heat low and stir quickly.
- The starchy pasta water helps create a creamy sauce.
