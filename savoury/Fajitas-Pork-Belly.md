## Method Part 1 - Day before cooking

1. **Marinade**
   
   A. **For Teriyaki - Make the Marinade**
   - 16-24 hrs before you want to eat you need to prepare
   - Mix together the Honey and soy sauce 
   - Quantity is subjective to amount of pork belly

   B. **For Sweet Chilli - Get the bottle out**

2. **Adding the marinade to the Pork Belly**
   - Add the Pork belly to a bowl (Preferably glass)
   - Pour the sauce over the top until mostly covered
   - Using a fork, stab holes into both sides of the pork belly to make sure the sauce penetrates the meat

3. **Marinate the Pork Belly**
   - Cover the pork belly with Aluminium Foil
   - Put the pork belly bowl inot the fridge for ~20 hours  

## Method Part 2 - Cooking day

1. **Cook the PorkBelly:**
   - Preheat the Oven to 160°C
   - Remove the aluminimum foil and put the pork belly in the oven
   - Cook for 2 - 2.5 hours

#### **After 1.5 - 2 hours (You need about 30 minutes of oven time left now, depending on total time)** 

2. **Prep the Ingredients:**
   - Slice peppers and onions into strips.
   - Prepare baby corn (slice lengthways if whole).

3. **Heating the Pan:**
   - Heat your stainless steel pan over medium heat until the oil shimmers slightly.
   - Use the water test: a drop should sizzle.
   - Alternatively, place the end of a wooden spoon in the oil; bubbles should form.

4. **Add Baby Corn:**
   - Add baby corn to the pan stir together.
   - Cook until browned and tender.

5. **Add Peppers and Onions:**
   - Add peppers and stir until browned and tender.
   - Add onions and stir. Cook 2 minutes.

6. **Pork Belly:**
   - Get Pork Belly out of the oven and leave to rest for a minute.
   - Slice into small chunks and add to the pan of vegtables
   - Fry for a moment to incorporate the meat with the Veg

7. **Finish with Sauce:**
   - Add the marinate sauce from the oven bowl and stir to coat everything.
   - Cook until sauce has reduced and turned sticky.

8. **Serve:**
   - Warm the tortillas.
   - Spoon the fajita mixture into each tortilla.
   - Top with cheese.
   - Serve immediately.

## Tips

- Baby corn goes in first as it needs the most time.
- Peppers should soften but still have bite.
- Onions go in last to stay sweet, not mushy.
- **Never add salt directly to a cold stainless steel pan; always season once food is in the pan to avoid pitting**
