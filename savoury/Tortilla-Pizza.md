# Tortilla Pizza

## Ingredients

### Sauce Base

- 4 tbsp passata
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- 7.5ml olive oil (1/2 tbsp)
- 1/2 tsp dried herbs (mixed herbs, basil, or oregano)
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Toppings

- 2 plain tortillas
- 50g grated mozzarella
- 6–8 slices pepperoni
- 6–8 pickled jalapeño slices

## Method

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Heat the oven to 200°C (fan mode).

2. **Make the Sauce:**
   - Mix passata, crushed garlic, olive oil, and dried herbs in a bowl.
   - Season well with salt and pepper.

3. **Prepare the Tortillas:**
   - Place tortillas on one large baking sheet or two smaller ones.

4. **Spread the Sauce:**
   - Spread the tomato sauce over each tortilla, leaving a 1cm border around the edges.

5. **Add Toppings:**
   - Scatter mozzarella over each pizza.
   - Add pepperoni slices and pickled jalapeños.

6. **Bake:**
   - Bake for 6–8 minutes until the edges are crisp and golden, and the cheese has melted and is bubbling.

7. **Serve:**
   - Remove from oven and serve immediately.

## Tips

- Don't skip the 1cm border — it helps the edges crisp up nicely.
- If you prefer less spice, use fewer jalapeños or omit them entirely.
- For extra flavour, brush the tortilla edges with a bit of garlic oil before baking.
