# Bolognese - Dom’s own

## Ingredients

### Meat & Veg

- 500g of 5% fat minced beef
- 2-3 small green/brown onions
- 2-4 sweet pointed red peppers
- 2 long carrots (grated fine)

### Sauce

- 1-2 tins of chopped tomatoes
- 1-2 pots of tomato passata
- A splash of red wine

### Extras:

- 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil
- 2-5 leaves of fresh basil, rolled up and chopped lengthways
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Your choice of pasta - Rigatoni recommended! 

## Method

1. **Preparation:**
   - **Chop the onions and peppers** into small chunks. 
   - **Grate the carrots** - using the finest grate.
   - Layer the basil and Roll into a tight tube, slice lengthways. 

2. **Heating the Pan:**
   - **Heat your stainless steel pan** over medium heat until the oil shimmers slightly.
   - **Use the water test:** a drop should sizzle.
   - Alternatively, place the end of a wooden spoon in the oil; bubbles should form.

3. **Cooking:**
   - **Brown the Beef:** Add the minced beef to the pan. Cook until browned, breaking it up with a spatula (5-7 minutes).
   - **Remove Excess Fat:** If there’s excess fat, drain it off.
   - **Sauté Vegetables:** Add onions and peppers, cooking for 5 minutes until softened.
   - **Add Carrots & Spices:** Stir in the grated carrots, smoked paprika, and Italian herbs. Cook until the carrots are slightly tender, about 3 minutes.

4. **Building the Sauce:**
   - **Deglaze with Wine:** Pour in red wine, scraping up browned bits from the pan. Allow the wine to reduce for 2-3 minutes.
   - **Add Tomatoes:** Stir in chopped tomatoes and passata. Mix well to combine.
   - **Simmer:** Bring the mixture to a simmer, then lower the heat. Add extra red wine here to enhance flavour, taste depending.  Allow to simmer for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. This time allows the flavours to meld together.
   - **Cook Pasta:** Whilst sauce is simmering, bring a pan of water to boil, add in the pasta and cook for 8-10 minutes (or whatever is specified for your choice of pasta) quickly. 

5. **Finish and Serve:**
   - **Add Basil:** Stir in fresh basil before serving. This adds a fresh flavour to the sauce.
   - **Adjust Seasoning:** Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.
   - **Serve:** Serve the sauce over your favourite pasta.

## Tips

- Allow the sauce to rest for a few minutes off the heat before serving for enhanced flavour.
