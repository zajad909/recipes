## Bolognese - Dom’s own

## Ingredients

### Meat & Veg

- 500g of 5% fat minced beef
- 2-3 small green/brown onions
- 2-4 sweet pointed red peppers
- 2 long carrots (grated)

### Sauce

- 1-2 tins of chopped tomatoes
- 1-2 pots of tomato passata
- A splash of red wine

### Extras:

- 1 tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil
- A bit of fresh basil, chopped
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Method

1. **Preparation:**
   - Chop the onions and peppers.
   - Grate the carrots.
   - Chop the fresh basil.
2. **Heating the Pan:**
   - Heat your sauté pan over medium heat until the oil shimmers slightly.
   - Use the water test: a drop should sizzle.
   - Alternatively, place the end of a wooden spoon in the oil; bubbles should form.
3. **Cooking:**
   - **Brown the Beef:** Add the minced beef to the pan. Cook until browned, breaking it up with a spatula (5-7 minutes).
   - **Remove Excess Fat:** If there’s excess fat, drain it off.
   - **Sauté Vegetables:** Add onions and peppers, cooking for 5 minutes until softened.
   - **Add Carrots & Spices:** Stir in the grated carrots, smoked paprika, and Italian herbs. Cook until the carrots are slightly tender, about 3 minutes.
4. **Building the Sauce:**
   - **Deglaze with Wine:** Pour in red wine, scraping up browned bits from the pan. Allow the wine to reduce for 2-3 minutes.
   - **Add Tomatoes:** Stir in chopped tomatoes and passata. Mix well to combine.
   - **Simmer:** Bring the mixture to a simmer, then lower the heat. Add extra red wine here to enhance flavour, taste depending.  Allow to simmer for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. This time allows the flavours to meld together.
5. **Finish and Serve:**
   - **Add Basil:** Stir in fresh basil before serving. This adds a fresh flavour to the sauce.
   - **Adjust Seasoning:** Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.
   - **Serve:** Serve the sauce over your favourite pasta.

## Tips

- Your pan can withstand high temperatures up to 260°C.
- Ensure even heat distribution and avoid unnecessary high heat.
- Use CoolTouch® handles for safety.
- Allow the sauce to rest for a few minutes off the heat before serving for enhanced flavour.
