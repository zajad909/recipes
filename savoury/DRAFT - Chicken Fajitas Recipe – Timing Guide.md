## Important Pan Notes  
**ProCook Elite Signature Sauté Pan – 26cm**

### Heat Management

- Uncoated stainless steel with tri-ply construction — excellent for searing and charring
- Reduce initial heat to **medium-high**, not high  
- Stainless steel heats quickly and can overheat easily
- Manual warns against using high heat or boost settings (except for boiling water)
- Preheat for **1–2 minutes**, not longer

### Key Benefits of Your Pan

- **3.2L capacity** — plenty of room to avoid overcrowding
- **Rivetless interior** for easier cleaning after charring
- **Oven safe to 260°C** if finishing in the oven
- **Dishwasher safe** for easy cleanup

## Salt Warning

⚠️ **Never add salt directly to a cold pan surface.**  
Always add salt to hot food or liquid to avoid pitting the stainless steel.
