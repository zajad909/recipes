## Method

1. **Prepare the Pork:**

   - Mix well.

4. **Combine Pork and Sauce:**
   - Remove pork from air fryer and place in a wok.
   - Pour the gochujang sauce over the pork.
   - Warm through over low heat, stirring to coat the pork evenly.

5. **Finish and Serve:**

   - Serve over Jasmine rice.

- Don't overcook after adding the sauce — just warm through.
