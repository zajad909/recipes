# Sausage Fajitas

## Ingredients

### Proteins

- 6 pork sausages (or your preferred sausages), sliced into rounds about 10–15mm thick

### Vegetables

- 2 red peppers, sliced into strips
- 3 onions, sliced into strips
- 2 packets baby corn

### Extras:

- 15ml olive oil (1 tablespoon)
- Cheese for topping
- Flour tortillas for serving
- Optional: sesame seeds for garnish

### Sauce

- 60ml soy sauce
- 60ml honey
- Optional: 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- Optional: sesame seeds for garnish

Mix soy sauce and honey in a small bowl (1:1 ratio). If using, stir in sesame oil.

## Method

1. **Prep the Ingredients:**
   - Slice sausages into rounds about 10–15mm thick.
   - Slice peppers and onions into chunks.
   - Prepare baby corn (slice lengthways if whole and then cut into reasonably sized chunks).

2. **Heat the Pan:**
   - Heat the stainless steel pan over medium heat until the oil shimmers slightly.
   - Use the water test: a drop should sizzle.
   - Alternatively, place the end of a wooden spoon in the oil; bubbles should form.

3. **Cook the Sausage Rounds:**
   - Add sausage slices in a single layer.
   - Let them brown without stirring for 2–3 minutes, then turn or stir and cook another 2–3 minutes until golden and cooked through.

4. **Add Baby Corn:**
   - Push sausages to one side.
   - Add baby corn and stir together. Cook 2–3 minutes until tender.

5. **Add Peppers and Onions:**
   - Add peppers and cook 2 minutes.
   - Add onions and cook 2 minutes until softened but with a little bite.

6. **Finish with Teriyaki Sauce:**
   - Pour the homemade teriyaki (1:1 soy:honey) over the pan and stir to coat everything.
   - Cook 1–2 minutes until hot and glossy. Sprinkle sesame seeds if using.

7. **Serve:**
   - Warm the tortillas.
   - Spoon the fajita mixture into each tortilla.
   - Top with cheese and extra sesame seeds if desired.
   - Serve immediately.

## Tips

- Slice sausages 10–15mm thick so they cook quickly and are easier to split into wraps.
- Total cooking time is approximately 18–22 minutes depending on sausage thickness.
- Don't overcrowd the pan — work in batches if needed to get good browning.
- Adjust teriyaki sweetness by changing the honey amount; extra soy for saltiness.
- For extra char, finish under a hot grill for 1–2 minutes before serving.
