## Tips

- Total cooking time is approximately 18–20 minutes.
- Baby corn goes in first as it needs the most time.
- Peppers should soften but still have bite.
- Onions go in last to stay sweet, not mushy.
- Don't overcrowd the pan — let ingredients char before stirring.
- Never add salt directly to a cold stainless steel pan; always season once food is in the pan to avoid pitting.
