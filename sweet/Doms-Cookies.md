Ingredients - 1 batch:
170g Caster sugar
270g brown sugar
3 teaspoon salt
200g Stork
2 eggs
3 teaspoon vanilla extract
260g plain flour  
1 teaspoon baking powder
200g milk chocolate chunks
200g dark chocolate chunk

Preparation 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps. 2. Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture. 3. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to over-mix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies). 4. Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavour and deeper colour, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavour will be. 5. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 6. Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly. 7. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. 8. Cool completely before serving. 9. Enjoy!
