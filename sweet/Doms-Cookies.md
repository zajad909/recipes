# Dom's Cookies

## Ingredients

### Sugars & Fats

- 170g caster sugar
- 270g brown sugar
- 200g Stork (or butter)
- 3 tsp salt

### Eggs & Flavour

- 2 eggs
- 3 tsp vanilla extract

### Dry Ingredients

- 260g plain flour
- 1 tsp baking powder

### Chocolate

- 200g milk chocolate chunks
- 200g dark chocolate chunks

## Method

1. **Cream the Base:**
   - In a large bowl, whisk together the caster sugar, brown sugar, salt, and Stork until a paste forms with no lumps.

2. **Add Wet Ingredients:**
   - Whisk in the eggs and vanilla extract.
   - Beat until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.

3. **Combine Dry Ingredients:**
   - Sift the flour and baking powder together.
   - Fold into the wet mixture with a spatula.
   - Be careful not to over-mix, which would toughen the gluten and make cakier cookies.

4. **Add Chocolate:**
   - Fold in the milk and dark chocolate chunks.

5. **Chill the Dough:**
   - Chill for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight for a more intense flavour and deeper colour.
   - The longer the dough rests, the more complex the flavour will be.

6. **Preheat and Prepare:**
   - Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).
   - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

7. **Scoop and Space:**
   - Scoop dough with an ice-cream scoop onto the baking sheet.
   - Leave at least 10cm between cookies and 5cm from the edges of the pan so they can spread evenly.

8. **Bake:**
   - Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the edges have just started to brown.

9. **Cool:**
   - Allow cookies to cool completely on the baking sheet before serving.

## Tips

- Chilling the dough overnight produces the best flavour and texture.
- Don't overbake — the edges should just start to brown; the centres will continue to cook as they cool.
- These cookies are chewy in the centre and crispy at the edges when baked correctly.
